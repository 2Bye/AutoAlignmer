# AutoAlignmer-

This code allows you to automatically cut large audio files into small ones, taking into account some filtering parameters

Models used in this project
* Vad NeMo [https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo]
* AudioTagging model [https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn]


To run the aligner, you need model checkpoints (you can use the open checkpoints in the model repositories)
